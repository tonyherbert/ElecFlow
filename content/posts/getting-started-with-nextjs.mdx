Next.js 15 brings exciting new features that make building web applications easier than ever. In this guide, we'll explore the key concepts you need to know.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides a great developer experience with features like:

- **Server Components** - Render components on the server for better performance
- **App Router** - A new routing system based on React Server Components
- **Built-in Optimizations** - Automatic image, font, and script optimization

## Getting Started

First, create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Creating Your First Page

In Next.js 15, pages are created in the `app` directory:

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to my app!</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Server vs Client Components

By default, all components in the `app` directory are Server Components. To use client-side features, add the `"use client"` directive:

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

## What's Next?

Now that you understand the basics, explore more advanced topics like data fetching, authentication, and deployment.
