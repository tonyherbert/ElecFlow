Our application comes with two components that allow users to contact you.

## ContactSupportDialog

This component displays a modal with a form to contact support.

### Form Fields

- **email** - Only displayed if the user is not logged in
- **subject** - The message subject
- **message** - The message content

### Basic Usage

```tsx
<ContactSupportDialog />
```

By default, a button with the text "Contact support" is displayed.

### Custom Usage

You can customize the button or trigger area by passing child content:

```tsx
<ContactSupportDialog>
  <button>Need help?</button>
</ContactSupportDialog>
```

### Behavior

- When the form is submitted, an email is sent to the address defined in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_CONTACT` environment variable
- A toast "Your message has been sent." is displayed on success
- An error toast is displayed on failure
- The modal closes automatically after a successful submission

## ContactFeedbackPopover

- **message** - The feedback content
- **review** - A rating system with 4 emojis:
  - (1) - Extremely dissatisfied
  - (2) - Rather dissatisfied
  - (3) - Neutral

### Basic Usage

## FAQ

### When should I use ContactSupportDialog?

ContactSupportDialog is useful when you want to allow users to report issues or ask questions. It is already used several times in error pages to allow users to quickly report a problem.

ContactFeedbackPopover is ideal for quickly collecting general feedback on the user experience. It's less intrusive than a full modal and allows quick rating with emojis.
