If you need to render Markdown in our React application, you can easily do so with the two components provided.

## ClientMarkdown

This component allows you to display Markdown **client-side**, meaning it is not rendered server-side. It uses the `markdown-to-jsx` library to parse and render Markdown.

```tsx
import { ClientMarkdown } from "@/features/markdown/client-markdown";

const markdown = `
# Hello World

This is a paragraph

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
`;

export default function App() {
  return <ClientMarkdown>{markdown}</ClientMarkdown>;
}
```

### Props

- `children: string` - The Markdown content to render
- `className?: string` - Custom CSS classes (replaces the default `typography` class)
- All other `markdown-to-jsx` props are supported

### Default Styling

By default, this component applies the `typography` class. You can replace it by passing a `className` prop to the component.

## ServerMdx

This component allows you to display Markdown **server-side**, meaning the HTML is generated server-side and the client only receives the final render.

Why `Mdx`? Because this component supports `mdx` syntax, which is a markdown extension allowing you to add React components in Markdown.

```tsx
import { ServerMdx } from "@/features/markdown/server-mdx";

const markdown = `
# Hello World

This is a paragraph

<Alert type="info">
  This is an information message
</Alert>
`;

export default async function Page() {
  return <ServerMdx source={markdown} />;
}
```

### Props

- `source: string` - The MDX content to render
- `className?: string` - Custom CSS classes (applied to the wrapper div, added to the default `typography` class)

### Adding Custom React Components

**By default**, no React components are supported. To add them, you need to modify the `src/features/markdown/server-mdx.tsx` file:

```tsx
import { Alert } from "@/components/nowts/alert";

const MdxComponent = {
  Alert: Alert,
  // Add other components here
} satisfies Record<string, React.ComponentType>;
```

Complete example with an `Alert` component:

```mdx
# My Document

This is a normal paragraph.

<Alert type="info">This is an information message</Alert>
```

## FAQ

### When should I use ServerMdx vs ClientMarkdown?

- **Use ServerMdx when:**
  - You need to integrate custom React components in your Markdown
  - You want rendering to be done server-side (better for performance)
  - You need MDX

- **Use ClientMarkdown when:**
  - You have basic Markdown without React components
  - You're rendering Markdown content dynamically client-side

### Can I use React components in ClientMarkdown?

No, `ClientMarkdown` only supports basic Markdown. To integrate React components, you must use `ServerMdx`.
